# decision-manager
## Node.js , VueJs, Socket.io, Lokijs light decision manager

If u like me dont whant use a heavy decision manager like Drools or Redhat decision manager u can clone and fork this idea
I use LokiJs to store decisions and VueJs to crud it and hardcode cases for my needs.
This example make a decision for loan and calculate rate whith discount 
Peace
